            <h1>About</h1>
            <p>I am a full-stack software engineer based in London.</p>
            <p>
                I have expertise in designing, implementing, and maintaining
                full-stack applications with proficiency in Node, React, Python,
                Git, CI/CD, and RESTful APIs.
            </p>
            <p>
                I have also experience collaborating in modern software
                methodologies like test-driven development, pair programming, code
                reviews and AGILE.
            </p>
            <p>
                Before becoming a software engineer and graduating from Makers
                Academy, I worked as an architect for five years, where I learnt a
                great deal about attention to detail, team collaboration, developing
                technical documentation and meeting given specifications in time.
            </p>
            <p>
                I'm looking forward to being part of a dynamic, agile team, solving
                new challenges and building innovative digital technology.
